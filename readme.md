This is supposed to be as simple-as-possible.
- The server.js file does all routing and database access
- The public/index.html has all the client side stuff
- Comments try to explain what everything does

To make it work on your machine:
- Clone this using **git clone https://github.com/alexcasper/simplerdbaccess.git**  .
- Get the MySql and Express modules by doing 'npm install' in the correct directory.
- Update the database config settings in client to work with your database.
- Change the query to get the information you need, in the format you need it.
- Update the client code, or incorporate it into your existing website.

This is not super *secure* or an example of *best-practice*. It's a hack.

If you need any further help you can reach me on *casper*-aht-*ada*-doht-*ac*-doht-*uk* or using the correct incantations.
